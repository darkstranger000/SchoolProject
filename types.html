                    <Strong>➤ Direct Plagiarism:</Strong> Direct plagiarism is the word-for-word transcription of a section of someone else’s work,
                    <br>without attribution and without quotation marks. The deliberate plagiarism of someone else's work is unethical, 
                    <br>academically dishonest, and grounds for disciplinary actions, including expulsion.<br><br>
                    <Strong>➤Self Plagiarism:</Strong> Self-plagiarism occurs when a student submits his or her own previous work,
                    or mixes parts of <br>previous works, without permission from all professors involved. For example,
                    it would be unacceptable to<br> incorporate part of a term paper you wrote in high school into a paper
                    assigned in a college course Self-plagiarism <br>also applies to submitting the same piece of work
                    for assignments in different classes without previous permission<br> from both professors.<br><br>
                    <Strong>➤Mosaic Plagiarism: </Strong>Mosaic Plagiarism occurs when a student borrows phrases from a source without 
                    using <br>quotation marks, or finds synonyms for the author’s language while keeping to the same general 
                    structure and<br> meaning of the original. Sometimes called “patch writing,” this kind of paraphrasing,
                    whether intentional or not, <br> is academically dishonest and punishable – even if you footnote your source!<br><br>
                    <strong>➤Accidental Plagiarism:</strong>Accidental plagiarism occurs when a person neglects to cite their sources, 
                    or misquotes their<br> sources, or unintentionally paraphrases a source by using similar words, groups of words, and/or 
                    sentence structure<br>  without attribution.  Lack of intent does not absolve the student of responsibility for plagiarism.
                    Cases of accidental<br>  plagiarism are taken as seriously as any other plagiarism and are subject to the same range
                    of consequences as other<br>  types of plagiarism.
