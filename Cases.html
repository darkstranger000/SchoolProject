                <strong style="font-size: larger; color: #1865a8;">1.</strong>In 2013, the group “Blurred Lines” was 
                accused of plagiarism by children of Marvin Gaye. Gayes children charged $7.3 million for the borrowed 
                song with the name “Got to Give Up” originally authored by their father. The group-members admitted
                the similarities in their hit and the song of Marvin Gaye. However, they attribute such similarities to a 
                coincidence rather than to plagiarizing. In any case,<strong> $7.3 million 
                is an impressive pay for a so-called coincidence!</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong style="font-size: larger; color: #1865a8;">2.</strong>One of the most ridiculous plagiarism lawsuits
                is the case of Taylor Swift who is alleged in plagiarizing lyrics from the song of R&B singers Jesse Braham.
                The last accuses Taylor Swift of using several sentences from his song “Haters Gonna Hate” in her song “Shake It Off”.
                Braham plans to<strong> sue $42 million for this coincidence</strong>. However, most reviewers note that particular phrase is not
                a kind of intellectual property, but rather an often used rhyme. Thus, the allegations look like a ridiculous try 
                to make the “easy money”.

                <strong style="font-size: larger; color: #1865a8;">3.</strong>Senator Joseph Biden was guilty in plagiarism and 
                was forced to withdraw from the presidential election campaign in 1988. Senator admitted that he misleadingly plagiarized
                the text in his first work of introductory methodology class, and did not provide the correct citations. To clear his
                reputation, Joe Biden brought this case to the Delaware Supreme Court, and the Court dismissed the allegations. 
                However, later in his political career, Joe Biden was accused of plagiarism again. That time, the case contained 
                the plagiarism instances in his public speeches, where he did not give the proper credit to such authors as Senator 
                Kennedy and Neil Kinnock. <strong>The consequences of plagiarism were the withdrawal from the Presidential Campaign.</strong>

                <strong style="font-size: larger; color: #1865a8;">4.</strong>The German Minister of Defense Karl-Theodor 
                zu Guttenberg was alleged in plagiarizing the part of his dissertation. The analytical review of his work showed that 
                approximately 63% of the entire text was borrowed without accreditation. <strong>Guttenberg was immediately dismissed from his 
                high position and lost the Doctorship title.</strong>

                <br>
                <strong style="font-size: larger; color: #1865a8;">5.</strong>Annette Schavan, who was the German Minister of 
                Education and Research was accused of plagiarism in her PhD dissertation paper. The University of Dusseldorf initiated 
                the investigation which led to the conclusion, that 60 secondary sources were used in the work without any attribution 
                to the authorship. After the findings, Annette Schavan was <strong>resigned from her Minister Position and her PhD title was 
                revoked.</strong>
